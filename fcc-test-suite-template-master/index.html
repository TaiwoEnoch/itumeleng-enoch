          Mandela was born in Mvezo, South Africa to a Thembu royal family.
          His government focused on throwing out the legacy of apartheid by ending racism, poverty, inequality, 
          and on improving racial understanding in South Africa. Politically a believer in socialism, he served 
          as the President of the African National  Congress (ANC) from 1991 to 1997 and adopted new Constitution of South African
          in 1996 that prohibits all discrimination, based on language, religion, handicap and sexual orientation, 
          not only on racism. Internationally, Mandela was the Secretary General of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999.
